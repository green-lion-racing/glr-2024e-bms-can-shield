# CAN-Shield for NUCLEO-G474RE

NUCLEO-G474RE compatible CAN shield, which is our main microcontroller for the battery management system (BMS/AMS).

### Overview

Acts as can transciever for the BMS. Also has an output pin in case of a BMS fault.

CAN 1 is designated for the communication with FSGs datalogger, because of the high 1Mbit CAN baudrate.

CAN 2 is designated to communicate with the rest of the car, at a lower baudrate.

Compatible to the Analog Devices EVAL-ADBMS6822 board, can be slotted onto the board at the same time.

Accessible screw terminals for signals to the board.

Can be directly slotted on to the board.
